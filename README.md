# CatTrivia
This is a fun cat trivia game you can enjoy by yourself or with up to 3 friends! This game works by prompting a question from the server that waits for a response from all of the clients, whether it be you or your friends. Once the server recieves a response, it will wait until the each of the players has answered and can print out the correct answer. If the answer is correct, the server checks the order in which the responses were received, with the first response coming in being the one that is awarded the point. All other players who answered incorrectly or after the first correct response will not be rewarded points. This game is created by Isabella Barnard. This was made as an assignment for CS457.
